y,*PROPNAME*. ;)
y,"thinks *PROPNAME* deserves yet another apology from Warner Brothers.  For multiple reasons.  How do you leave out the big, climactic battle scene of a book?  How does that happen?

y,"""The world may end in 2012 but this show won't."" XD LOL!"
y,"Hmm, that wasn't too bad. Had me worried for a minute.  I've certainly seen worse endings. Like freakin' Fallen! Seriously, what the crap was that?! Anyways, not bad. ^^"
y,Huh. I stand corrected.

n,"Everlasting, Eternal One, Zealous Conqueror, Creator, Sustainer, Almighty...how can I appeal to your highest pleasure. What can I bring to you that you do not already have? Vanity. Even to define my mission as one to bring you glory is utter foolishness. What can I lift up with these dirty hands? What can I sing with defiled lips?"

Lord, at this rate, it'll take You coming on the clouds, blowing our minds and shaking us from our complacent lives...complacent in the daily grind. Complacent in our justifiable self-pity. Complacent in our self-centeredness. It'll take You to show us how wrong we all are."

y,"just saw a tragic//comedic drama - August: Osage County - and thought it was intensely true and devastating and redemptive and isolating and packed with anger, hurt, joy, confusion, misunderstandings, and innocent deceptions.

n,just had a wonderful chat with *PROPNAME* on the phone and is about to start making dinner:)
n,"went to see ""The Hangover"" tonight then came home to enjoy a nice relaxing jacuzzi tub bath with a glass of wine...life doesn't get much better than that!"
n,For once I meant to let my phone battery die all the way before recharging and did I remember to plug it in once it reached that point? Not until just now...oops
n,is making rice krispies treats!
n,Is excited to have 2 more new books from Paperback swap but can't decide what to read now!
n,is annoyed that GM decided it would be cool to have some stupid ass bracket for wiper blades on the G6 resulting in me having to pay $70 for replacement blades.
n,"had a good workout at the gym this afternoon, just took a nice relaxing jacuzzi bath and now off to bed with fresh from the dyer sheets. Ahhhhh fantastic:)"
n,"The first 2 Atlantic tropical storms, *PROPNAME* and *PROPNAME*, have formed. I'm not too worried but have to admit there's a little unease about the idea of something making it here. Afterall, this is my first rodeo!"
n,*PROPNAME* and her friend are coming to visit me next weekend!!! So excited!!!
n,had a great day with a wonderful friend and a wonderful evening with a great boyfriend. I'm one lucky girl:)
n,"Sometimes, I'll watch a movie that I watched when I was younger and suddenly realize I had no idea what the f**k was going on when I first saw it."
n,is nervous about getting cavities filled for the first time ever tomorrow:( The up side is that it probably isn't as bad as repair work from stepping on a shovel;) There I feel a bit better now!
n,is excited about dinner and movie date night:)
n,"How many times is it appropriate to say ""What?"" before you just nod and smile because you still didn't hear what they said?"

n,"I like all of the music in my iTunes, except when it's on shuffle, then I like about one in every fifteen songs in my iTunes."

n,off to the store to get the things I need to make caramel apple cookies. I hope that mine turn out as good as the picture! I also hope that they have the caramel bits I need at this Walmart!
n,is wondering what the heck? Last week my computer hard drive died and just a few minutes ago I got the blue screen of death from my DirecTV box saying a problem has been detected on my hard drive. Not cool.
n,Fantastic day of hanging out with friends and doing some shopping:) Relaxing on the couch reading for a bit
n,had a busy day. Time for a nap before possibly carving pumpkins this evening:)
n,perhaps *PROPNAME* putting off getting our Halloween costumes for so long was really his way of helping me find my awesome costume idea :)

n,Carving pumpkins with *PROPNAME*...pictures to come soon:)
n,shooting and punching some stuff in Borderlands:)
n,"just heard a commercial on the radio about some pill to lower cholesterol. They actually said ""Do you have high cholesterol due to poor diet or lack of exercise? Then you need to try this""  No, actually you need to try improving your diet and exercising a bit first.  Just a crazy thought I had..."
n,is happy that my new hard drive is installed. Yay!
n,is pretty sure I'm coming down with whatever *PROPNAME* considering I just folded a load of towels and now feel completely drained.  The good news is that the TV is working again:)

n,"doesn't know what to make of the fact that based on my interest in TV shows like ""Brotherhood"" and ""Californication"" , Netflix has a recommendations section of other ""Dysfunctional family dramas""  This includes ""Dexter"" and ""Rescue Me"" which are both shows I watch. Oh Netflix you know me so well."
n,is not sure what the repairman fiddled with yesterday to get some warm air to come out of the heater for a while but I'm pretty sure that the heat is still not working quite right considering that after running for 8 hours with the thermostat set to 72 it is still only 65 in my house and there is cool..no cold air blasting out of the vents...and yes it is on heat not AC;)
n,"wasn't very impressed with ""Taking of Pelham 123"" although I was amused by *PROPNAME*'s character talking about the girl he took to Iceland..a Lithuanian ass model named Lavitika.  Ha"
n,is happy to have a new working DirecTV box. I can open the guide and switch channels without it freezing....and the DVR works. I can now go back to waiting until a few minutes into a show before I start watching and then fast forward through commercials!

n,"can't believe it. I got the new Wii Fit Plus game, it has a lot of fun new games and features. However, after not using the wii fit for a few months we decided to do the fitness test stuff again. Me(since last time): +2.9 lbs, still a healthy weight and BMI, wii age 54. *PROPNAME*: -8.6lbs, reccommends a healthy weight of gaining 6lbs, wii age 32. On the positive side, I have lost 5 of the 8 lbs I gained over the holidays!"
n,"was annoyed with the state of LA for sending a notice that my car policy was cancelled on 11//20//2009 even though that is just my renewal date and they lost the info my insurance company sent...oh and it took them 2 months to do something about it. My grumpiness was fixed by talking to the rep at Progressive. She was friendly and talkative, like a less annoying version of the girl on the commercials. Thanks *PROPNAME*!"
n,is taking *PROPNAME* to the vet for her annual check-up. I know it's good for her I just always feel a bit bad because she hates it so much :(
n,"Dear Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles employees, I understand that you probably get stuck dealing with stupid, annoying people on a regular basis.  That doesn't mean you have to be rude to everyone, especially not the friendly people like me darn it!"
n,did an hour long workout and now I'm trying to convince myself to vacuum the house.
n,"Funny: Every time I have to spell a word over the phone using 'as in' examples, I will undoubtedly draw a blank and sound like a complete idiot. Today I had to spell my boss's last name to an attorney and said ""Yes that's G as in...(10 second lapse)..ummm...Goonies"""
n,has recooped from working out and has caught a cleaning bug!
n,is making sweet potatoe split pea soup. I hope it's good!
n,can't believe the amount of mosquitos outside already. Boo!
n,why oh why do I let myself watch animal cops shows? I just end up feeling a mix of sadness for the animals and almost rage towards the people involved.
n,set my calorie goal for wii fit tonight as a piece of fried chicken....turns out it takes a lot of work to burn off a piece of fried chicken!
n,"was enjoying my morning shower until one of those stupid Saints remixes came on the radio. I'm all for that kind of thing when I actually go to games, but I'm sick of hearing it in regular rotation on the radio."
n,A bit mean...but damn funny Sarchasm : The gulf between the author of  sarcastic wit and the person who doesn't get it.
n,is watching a movie:)
n,just finished playing wii fit plus and burned an ice cream cone worth of calories. Now it's ok for me to eat an ice cream right? Kidding:)
n,accidentally clicked the wrong button on a page. Sorry for sending that farmville thing to everyone!
n,"The feminine version of the name *PROPNAME* meaning ""the woman."" Basically never printed on magnets, mugs or other souvenir paraphernalia. Often mistaken for *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME* or *PROPNAME*. My name is *PROPNAME*, not *PROPNAME*, dammit. (Urbandictionary.com, type in your first name, copy and paste the first entry)"

n,feels bad for my sick boyfriend. I know he feels really crappy 'cause he's sitting still and not playing videogames!
n,thinks it might be time for a nap:)
n,is off to work out. I don't want to but it's been 3 days:(
n,doesn't think the changes to facebook were really needed but honestly I'm more annoyed with all the complaints I've seen about it. You get it for free so if that means every once in a while you have to deal with a new layout well...deal with it!:)
n,starting to make some delicious snacks to enjoy while watching the Superbowl later
n,is home from the Lockport Mardi Gras parade and is ready for a nap!
n,really wishes that my old doctor's office would learn how to do math. I don't appreciate getting rather large bills for amounts that BSBC and I have already paid. Oh and thanks for putting it in the 120 day slot so I get to stress about further stupidity on your part resulting in a bad outcome for me.
n,wonders how sick Bon Jovi is of singing this song

But it made me miss my NOLA soo much...as I told my dad, I'm sure I'll end up back home someday, but for now I need to be here. Sigh!   In other news, my cold is getting worse, blech. Trying everything I can to get rid of it quickly!"

y,"Well that was entertaining...got some of my dad's eggplant parm, but was treated to watching him, COMPLETELY sloshed, watch the Wizard of Oz and caterwaul all the words with both *PROPNAME* AND the wicked witch.

y,"Momentarily considered waxing poetic about the new year (one 'holiday' that is actually somewhat important to me), but it's all been said before, I'm sure.  Instead, I'm just gonna go get loads of sleep so I can enjoy tomorrow night's festivities wholeheartedly!"
y,Second half of last week quite sucked and was uneventful to boot...may this week be an improvement!  *kicks suckiness repeatedly with pointy!pointy!shoes*

y,Busybusybusy! :D Out & about is much better than in and bored!
y,"2010-wise, so far, so good!  Feeling pretty bloody fantastic compared to my emotional state of the last few months.  I've even been somewhat productive recently.  However, I am going home now; my desk chair has made my ass numb!  (How does one wake up a sleeping ass, haha?  I'll probably be sorry I asked...)"
y,Sick as a dog and hoping it doesn't snow too much.
y,My mind feels like a murder-suicide.  I hate this life so much it hurts...and it hurts so much I've been rendered numb.
y,"Re-conditioning my hands back into top gaming form--I used to be able to go all day (or for days) without a break (even to eat or go to the bathroom, lol...toldja I was obsessed!); currently my thumbs start to hurt after about 4 hours.  That's what I get for being outta practice, bah!"

'Course, meds need tweaking--one of 'em (dunno which) is also tryin to make me a zombie--not the fun movie kind, either: I get sleepy around 4 or 5 PM now; too damn early even if I weren't a night owl! PSYCHED bout the forward progress, but this zombie thing's crampin' my nightlife, oy!"
y,"Sick as a dog and wishing my heat worked better. Hoping for as little snow as possible, under these circumstances!"

y,Hopin' I'll sleep tonight! Went from one extreme to the other--sleeping all the time to not sleeping at all. What an unpleasant adventure this is being!
y,"Surreal night...I think I might've slept and just woke up every hour and lay awake for awhile before falling back asleep again--but conversely, I might've just lain awake and semi-insensible the whole night with periods of more awareness...not sure which!  Either way, I'm tired, but surprisingly decent otherwise!"
y,"Well, lived through the Carbon Monoxide shit, though it made me sick today--luckily not sick enough to go to the damn hospital I guess; just sick enough to be puking and bedridden today. Good thing I had the day off anyway for MLK day (but my dad didn't tell me that, so I woke up ill and panicky this afternoon--nice, lol). Furnace was fixed today, though, so no more CM troubles, I suppose!"
y,"WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!  (She says as she continues to be nerdy on her couch. :P)  Veggin' can be good when you're having sillyfuntime! :D  ...Takin' a vote though: after cartoons, shall I play arcadey fighters, RPGs, or go old-school?  Narrowed it down that far, but...so hard to choose hehe!"

y,*sigh*
y,"I try to keep my health complaints to others to a minimum these days, but...well, let's just say FUCK.  Sometimes I feel like being such a survivor is goddamned overrated."

y,Why do I insist on eating popsicles in winter?  OM NOM NOM
y,"The cleaner my apartment gets, the more of my hobbies I get back into (partially because I can find my stuff again, lol!)...YAYYY!  First one to return: gaming.  I might not get back to the rest of those erstwhile hobbies for awhile, though--I tend to get quiiite obsessive about my vidya games, hehe..."

y,Hmm...it's hard to play 'find the smell' in your apartment when it's so cold that sniffing the air hurts!  But why the fuck does my place smell like a lawnmower anyway?!
y,"Frisky Dingo makes my chest hurt...with laughing! I need to get Season 2 STAT. Damn, I would PILLAGE for some bourbon chicken right now! Glad *PROPNAME* is finally back in town...good times man! :D"

y,"Upon taking a brief hiatus from facebook--holy SHIT, too many updates to read! *mind boggles*"
y,"just remembered a TV ad from her childhood in the 'glorious' south: horribly fat, hideous ANGELS with big ol' hair, Tammy-Faye-esque makeup, and (of course) heavy southern accents hollering ""DON'T YOU BUY NO UUG-LY TRUUCK!"" Cracked me up then, cracks me up now, HAHA!"
y,Meow?
y,"Too lazy to scan 'retro' pics right now--fuck it, maybe later. I notice that I pretty much look the same as I have for the past ~15 years (kinda freaky!!)...thus, it's hard to tell what year a photo is from. Oddly enough, my skin was better when I was a teenager than it is now!"
y,Black.
y,"Well, meds situation is not ideal by any means (zombieish again) but it's a vast improvement on the last few days of horror!"
y,I think I've finally found the right med...this must be what normal people feel like!
y,"I feel pretty spiffy today--befuddling my dad with random comments, doin' my weird acrobatics and dances, singin' wordless nonsense songs...alot better than medicated zombie Bev (though admittedly alot more absurd, LOL)!  Sure spices up the office though haha--as long as I don't careen into the conference table!  :D"
y,"Fucking CARBON MONOXIDE alarm's going off repeatedly again tonight! Opened the windows & garage doors; I have nowhere else I can go & I need sleep, so I'm gonna hafta just hope the ventilation is enough cos I don't know what else to do. Hope I don't end up in the hospital over this shit--I'm sick of the damn hospital! (Well...bein' dead would [debatably] suck too. But I wouldn't be self-aware to know about it, lol.)"
y,has been too busy living life to spend much time on facebook this week--just the way I like it! :D
y,Whew.
y,"Got to be 'early to rise' tomorrow, so I'ma try to be 'early to bed' tonight...thusly, going to bed now; we'll see how that goes!"
y,is amused at the universe today. *cracks up*
y,"Hm...started the day out feeling ok, but now I feel like three-week-old leftovers molding in the back of a broken fridge in Hell...yes, a Hell-fridge. Guess work doesn't agree with me!"
y,"Been trying to catch up on sleep since I pretty much hadn't slept in 3 days...woken up by the Carbon Monoxide alarm, and it's the real deal.  My dad opened the window by the furnace and my living room window and went back to bed, nice.  Hmm...gonna go back to sleep if possible and hope halfheartedly that I'm still alive in the morning."

n,"is glad that it's summertime, and the living is easy. One of these mornings, she'll rise up singing."
n,"just got home from spending 11 glorious hours with her family. It was an awesome day. Sorry for all the missed calls and texts, my phone died many hours ago."
n,"I'm leavin' on a cruise ship, but I do know when I'll be back again. Seriously though, no phone or internet all week, so I will be incommunicado. You kids have fun, try not to do anything too crazy."
n,is home again! The Caribbean was amazing!
n,had good talkings tonight. Fun times were had by all.
n,One more double before nine days of freedom.
n,can't stop here! This is bat country!
n,"You win some, you lose some. Week 2 doesn't say anything about the Playoffs. There's always next week. And lets be fair, the competition next week is the Chiefs. Ahahaha."
n,ought to be cast in the next big zombie movie as an extra. Because she feels like the living dead must feel after a night of heavy brain-eating. Is that their equivalent of drinking? Explains why they want to do it all the time.
n,"needs to be herself, she can't be no one else. She's feeling supersonic, give her gin and tonic. She could have it all, but how much does she want it?"
n,"Damn, those Eagles looked sharp today. Too bad the Red Sox couldn't do the same."
n,Made some cash last night playing poker. Hopefully a repeat performance tonight?
n,hasn't felt the way she feels today in so long it's hard for her to specify.
n,"has got no time to for spreadin roots, the time has come to be gone. And though our health we drank a thousand times, it's time to ramble on."
n,is at a weird place in her life right now. A road map would be handy.
n,has the damn flu. Could the universe's timing have been any worse? She thinks not.
n,"Woot, go Chiefs. :D"
n,would love to have something that even remotely resembles a reasonable sleep schedule.
n,feels severely under-appreciated. It's lame.
n,"has had a very good day, and looks to have a good night also."
n,"doesn't look different, but she has changed. You're looking through her, she's not the same."
n,"wants to live where soul meets body, and let the sun wrap its arms around her, and bathe her skin in water cool and cleansing, and feel, feel what it's like to be new."
n,"has learned that standing in front of her open refridgerator and freezer doesn't make any of her food look any more appetizing, but it does start defrosting the food in her freezer."
n,proved her epic ninja skills tonight.
n,"shall live in the sunshine, swim the sea, and drink the wild air's salubrity."
n,was hoping some of the punk kids in her apartment complex would nab the jack-o-lanterns off her balcony and give them the honor of a good smash. Instead she had to unceremoniously toss them in the dumpster.
n,will begin tomorrow well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with her old nonsense.
n,is gonna blame it all upon a rush of blood to the head.
n,"had one of her worst nights ever at work, after spending all day actually believing today would be a good day."
n,"will have a bit of fun, watching everyone pass her by."
n,"is sitting in an English garden, waiting for the sun."
n,(573): Fact: The drinking you do in college doesn't affect your liver in real life.
n,wanted more than life could ever grant. She's bored with the chore of saving face.
n,"loves that she has some of the nerdiest friends ever. She's seen at least ten *PROPNAME* poems posted today. Granted, everyone picks the same one from V for Vendetta, but m'eh."
n,is feeling uninspired and unmotivated. Can someone else please pay her bills and move her into her new apartment?
n,is tired of being passed over.
n,has gotta tell you what a state she's in...
n,is having the worst day since yesterday.
n,learns more and more every day that timing is everything.
n,"is still living with your ghost, lonely and dreaming of the west coast. She just wants to feel some sunshine."
n,"just thought that you would know you're a god, and she is not."
n,"took these broken wings and learned to fly. All her life, she was only waiting for this moment to arise."
n,"doesn't want to be at the mercy of her emotions. She wants to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them."
n,"is watching the lights go down, letting the cables sleep. Whatever you say, it's all right, whatever you do it's all good."
n,"is simultaneously packing, doing laundry, cleaning, and jamming out.  Ah, productivity."
n,"is home from work and back to packing//cleaning. January 2nd can't come soon enough, because this is starting to get really monotonous."
n,can be painfully petty and selfish at times.
n,"Doppelgänger week; change your profile picture to someone famous you have been told you look like. After you update your profile with your evil twin photo, then cut and paste this to your status."
n,wants the kind of things that money just can't buy.
n,hates to admit that she's becoming more and more of a morning person.
n,is very glad to see that it's legitimately storming outside. If only she didn't have to go back to work in just a few minutes...
n,"is, by far, the biggest nerd she knows sometimes. Which really says a lot if you know her friends."
n,just realized she's been awake for 22 hours. That might explain the exhaustion.
n,"had an amazing night last night, in spite of the fact that she was literally falling asleep on her feet."
n,Your grace is more than enough. Re-prioritization in progress.

n,parade practice...worst time of the day
n,"He who strikes first, strikes twice."

n,The undertaking of a new action brings new strength
n,going for a long run hit me up later
n,Most people never run far enough on their first wind to find out they've got a second
n,"I like running because it's a challenge.  If you run hard, there's the pain - and you've got to work your way through the pain.  You know, lately it seems all you hear is? Don't overdo it' and? Don't push yourself.' Well, I think that's a lot of bull shit.  If you push the human body, it will respond"
n,The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it.
n,The trouble with being punctual is that nobody's there to appreciate it
n,if you want to be a leader try and act like one
n,"There is genius in persistence. It conquers all opposers. It gives confidence. It annihilates obstacles. Everybody believes in a determined man. People know that when he undertakes a thing, the battle is half won, for his rule is to accomplish whatever he sets out to do."
n,"If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am not for others, what am I?And if not now, when?"
n,lunch then going to work out....Any workout which does not involve a certain amount of danger or responsibility does not improve the body - it just wears it out
n,The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are
n,You don't drown by falling in water. You drown by staying there.
n,"If I had to select one quality, one personal characteristic that I regard as being most highly correlated with success, whatever the field, I would pick the trait of persistence. Determination. The will to endure to the end, to get knocked down seventy times and get up off the floor saying, ''Here comes number seventy-one!"
n,".if we wait for the moment when everything,  absolutely everything is ready, we shall never begin"
n,getting smoked tonight
n,"I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it."

n,good day...goodnight
n,got my battle rattle ready
n,Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance
n,Common sense in an uncommon degree is what the world calls wisdom
n,Executive ability is deciding quickly and getting somebody else to do the work.
n,Those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't.
n,Why did I want to win? because I didn't want to lose!
n,despise the fact i have already been up for almost 3 hours
n,Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent
n,The will to win means nothing without the will to prepare
n,"Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit."
n,I've got a great ambition to die of exhaustion rather than boredom
n,If life gives you lemons - make grapejuice. Then sit back and let people wonder how you did it.
n,"Since light travels faster than sound,  people appear bright until you hear them speak"
n,"If you can't convince them, confuse them"
n,first free weekend
n,The power of accurate observation is frequently called cynicism by those who don't have it
n,"Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure, than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat."
n,"Here's to you and here's to me, and I hope we never disagree. But, if that should ever be, to HELL with you, here's to ME"
n,Just because everything's different doesn't mean anything's changed
n,"As it is the characteristic of great wits to say much in few words, so small wits seem to have the gift of speaking much and saying nothing."
n,It doesn't work to leap a twenty-foot canyon in two ten-foot jumps
n,Common sense is instinct.  Enough of it is genius
n,finished ruck run
n,I've always felt it was not up to anyone else to make me give my best
n,Sometimes                            it is entirely appropriate to kill a fly with a sledge                            hammer
n,chem test
n,Dreams permit each and every one of us to be quietly and safely insane every night of our lives
n,"I'm not the greatest; I'm the double greatest. Not only do I knock 'em out, I pick the round."
n,"If one can stick to the training throughout the many long years, then will power is no longer a problem. It's raining? That doesn't matter. I am tired? That's besides the point. It's simply that I just have to"
n,"It seems rather incongruous that in a society of supersophisticated communication, we often suffer from a shortage of listeners"
n,"If the path less traveled were the easy path, then all would take it, thus making greatness simply average"
n,People demand freedom of speech to make up  for the freedom of thought which they avoid
n,"No matter where you go, there you are"
n,"There is no point at which you can say, Well, I'm successful now. I might as well take a nap"
n,"just got back from rugby and the weight room, going to eat....hit me up later"
n,"If                            you're in a fair fight, you didn't plan it properly"
n,Your             problem is that you think you have time
n,"Light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong. No matter how fast light travels, it finds the darkness has always got there first, and is waiting for it."
n,It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper
n,perseverance is more than endurance. it is endurance combined with absolute assurance and certainty that what we are looking for is going to happen
n,"Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way when you criticize them, you are a mile away from them and you have their shoes"
n,It is the characteristic excellence of the strong man that he can bring momentous issues to the fore and make a decision about them. The weak are always forced to decide between alternatives they have not chosen themselves.
n,"I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never expect it"
n,"Motivation is a fire from within. If someone else tries to light that fire under you, chances are it will burn very briefly"
n,Surprise Me
n,Success is not the result of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire.
n,"If a cluttered desk is the sign of a cluttered mind, what is the significance of a clean desk?"
n,Believing requires action
n,Between two evils i always pick the one ive never tried before
n,"Those who are more adapted to the active life can prepare themselves for contemplation in the practice of the active life, while those who are more adapted to the contemplative life can take upon themselves the works of the active life so as to become yet more apt for contemplation"
n,Where am I?
n,"Thinking is more interesting than knowing, but less interesting than looking"
n,"Man imposes his own limitations, don't set any"
n,"We run, not because we think it is doing us good, but because we enjoy it and cannot help ourselves...The more restricted our society and work become, the more necessary it will be to find some outlet for this craving for freedom.  No one can say, 'You must not run faster than this, or hump higher than that.'  The human spirit is indomitable"
n,"What I must do is all that concerns me. This rule, equally arduous in actual and intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it."
n,"Restlessness is dicontent, and discontent is the first neccesity of progress"
n,I cannot have survival as my only goal.  That would be too boring.

n,the slower we move the faster we die
n,"One reason we resist making deliberate choices is that choice equals change and most of us, feeling the world is unpredictable enough, try to minimise the trauma of change in our personal lives."
n,"There are four ways, and only four ways, in which we have contact with the world. We are evaluated and classified by these four contacts: what we do, how we look, what we say, and how we say it."
n,Success is often achieved by those who don't know that failure is inevitable.
n,"Workouts are like brushing my teeth; I don't think about them, I just do them.  The decision has already been made"
n,"Leadership is no more confined to process, than writing is to format"
n,"Staying up late reading an analysis of caesars civil war a man who lived by the quote audacity, more audacity, always audacity, his amazing success in life, war, and politics is yet another hwever old testament that fortune trully does favor the audacious a saying that seems to hold more truth with every experience i have"
n,"Everyone is trying to accomplish something big, not realizing that life is made up of little things"
n,not gonna sleep good tonight
n,"No bees, no honey; no work, no money."
n,that was fun
n,"I hate the expression ""What makes him tick.""  It is the American mind, looking for simple and singular solution, that uses the foolish expression.  A person not only ticks, he also chimes and strikes the hour, falls and breaks and has to be put together again, and sometimes stops like an electric clock in a thunderstorm"
n,going to work out..then mapping and setting up stx lanes for tonight hit me up if you want in
n,"Fight one more round. When your arms are so tired that you can hardly lift your hands to come on guard, fight one more round. When your nose is bleeding and your eyes are black and you are so tired that you wish your opponent would crack you one on the jaw and put you to sleep, fight one more round – remembering that the man who always fights one more round is never beaten"
n,"Earlier tonight, I found a picture of Waldo in jail. I didn't think much of it until I realized he was probably a wanted fugitive and that's why he is always hiding"
n,What is opportunity to the man who can't use it?
n,"Dont you find it Funny that after Monday(M) and Tuesday(T), the rest of the week says WTF?"
n,"The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled. For it is only in such moments, propelled by our discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers"
n,"Read, every day, something no one else is reading. Think, everyday, something no one else is thinking. Do, every day, something no one else would be crazy enough to do."
n,Someday
n,"There is no better time than now. The time to live is now. The time to dream is now. The time to imagine and forget the past is now. The time to shine is now. The time to bleed, sweat, and determine yourself for the things you want most is now."
n,All things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth.
n,All change is not growth; as all movement is not forward.
n,stx on friday hit me up if you want in....The greatest potential for control tends to exist at the point where action takes place.
n,Dream Great...Achieve Greatness
