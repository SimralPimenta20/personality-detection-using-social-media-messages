y,"both times you plan to tell them that and fail each time, so you right one of the longest, heartfelt notes about them to show them the next time you're with them and when you finally find your grand chance to see them and maybe finally tell them that they've meant more to you than anyone else you've ever known you find out that they've just got into a relationship with someone else."

y,This will probably take a good long while to get used to :) I think I'm still in shock. Haha. I have a fiance. Wow. And not just any fiance; I am pursuing the pearl of great value :D
y,"Everlasting, Eternal One, Zealous Conqueror, Creator, Sustainer, Almighty...how can I appeal to your highest pleasure. What can I bring to you that you do not already have? Vanity. Even to define my mission as one to bring you glory is utter foolishness. What can I lift up with these dirty hands? What can I sing with defiled lips?"
y,is waiting on the Lord this morning
y,"To understand how ridiculously excited I am to see my fiance, you must first win the lottery, do somersaults, run a hundred miles effortlessly, wake up to birds chirping, eat a super-yummy meal, and be addicted to oxygen...then you might get close to scratching the surface. Maybe"

y,"What makes people happy? Apparently we really suck at knowing what makes us happy. Its a measurable, replicable scientific fact. I dunno why that strikes me funny. lol. Lord, teach us to be joyful in you."

y,"Does it really take cancer or death to bring us to have a heart for our family? Really? Lord, at this rate, it'll take You coming on the clouds, blowing our minds and shaking us from our complacent lives...complacent in the daily grind. Complacent in our justifiable self-pity. Complacent in our self-centeredness. It'll take You to show us how wrong we all are."
y,has walked a thousand miles with grace so far. I could walk like this forever...Jesus how can you be so good to me?? May you be praised in every step I take. Always

y,"neoplatonic thinking postulates ""the one"" is infinite and gives rise, eventually, to this world of 'becoming"". Lord you were, are, and forever will be. My one. May I draw all life and thought from Your essential creativity. May I be made to be like Your form. Good."

n,"just saw a tragic//comedic drama - August: Osage County - and thought it was intensely true and devastating and redemptive and isolating and packed with anger, hurt, joy, confusion, misunderstandings, and innocent deceptions.

n,is wondering what the heck? Last week my computer hard drive died and just a few minutes ago I got the blue screen of death from my DirecTV box saying a problem has been detected on my hard drive. Not cool.
n,Fantastic day of hanging out with friends and doing some shopping:) Relaxing on the couch reading for a bit
n,had a busy day. Time for a nap before possibly carving pumpkins this evening:)
n,perhaps *PROPNAME* putting off getting our Halloween costumes for so long was really his way of helping me find my awesome costume idea :)

n,Carving pumpkins with *PROPNAME*...pictures to come soon:)

n,"just heard a commercial on the radio about some pill to lower cholesterol. They actually said ""Do you have high cholesterol due to poor diet or lack of exercise? Then you need to try this""  No, actually you need to try improving your diet and exercising a bit first.  Just a crazy thought I had..."
n,is happy that my new hard drive is installed. Yay!

n,"doesn't know what to make of the fact that based on my interest in TV shows like ""Brotherhood"" and ""Californication"" , Netflix has a recommendations section of other ""Dysfunctional family dramas""  This includes ""Dexter"" and ""Rescue Me"" which are both shows I watch. Oh Netflix you know me so well."
n,is not sure what the repairman fiddled with yesterday to get some warm air to come out of the heater for a while but I'm pretty sure that the heat is still not working quite right considering that after running for 8 hours with the thermostat set to 72 it is still only 65 in my house and there is cool..no cold air blasting out of the vents...and yes it is on heat not AC;)
n,"wasn't very impressed with ""Taking of Pelham 123"" although I was amused by *PROPNAME*'s character talking about the girl he took to Iceland..a Lithuanian ass model named Lavitika.  Ha"

n,"can't believe it. I got the new Wii Fit Plus game, it has a lot of fun new games and features. However, after not using the wii fit for a few months we decided to do the fitness test stuff again. Me(since last time): +2.9 lbs, still a healthy weight and BMI, wii age 54. *PROPNAME*: -8.6lbs, reccommends a healthy weight of gaining 6lbs, wii age 32. On the positive side, I have lost 5 of the 8 lbs I gained over the holidays!"
n,"was annoyed with the state of LA for sending a notice that my car policy was cancelled on 11//20//2009 even though that is just my renewal date and they lost the info my insurance company sent...oh and it took them 2 months to do something about it. My grumpiness was fixed by talking to the rep at Progressive. She was friendly and talkative, like a less annoying version of the girl on the commercials. Thanks *PROPNAME*!"
n,is taking *PROPNAME* to the vet for her annual check-up. I know it's good for her I just always feel a bit bad because she hates it so much :(
n,"Dear Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles employees, I understand that you probably get stuck dealing with stupid, annoying people on a regular basis.  That doesn't mean you have to be rude to everyone, especially not the friendly people like me darn it!"
n,did an hour long workout and now I'm trying to convince myself to vacuum the house.
n,"Funny: Every time I have to spell a word over the phone using 'as in' examples, I will undoubtedly draw a blank and sound like a complete idiot. Today I had to spell my boss's last name to an attorney and said ""Yes that's G as in...(10 second lapse)..ummm...Goonies"""
n,has recooped from working out and has caught a cleaning bug!
n,is making sweet potatoe split pea soup. I hope it's good!
n,can't believe the amount of mosquitos outside already. Boo!
n,why oh why do I let myself watch animal cops shows? I just end up feeling a mix of sadness for the animals and almost rage towards the people involved.
n,set my calorie goal for wii fit tonight as a piece of fried chicken....turns out it takes a lot of work to burn off a piece of fried chicken!
n,"was enjoying my morning shower until one of those stupid Saints remixes came on the radio. I'm all for that kind of thing when I actually go to games, but I'm sick of hearing it in regular rotation on the radio."
n,A bit mean...but damn funny Sarchasm : The gulf between the author of  sarcastic wit and the person who doesn't get it.
n,is watching a movie:)
n,just finished playing wii fit plus and burned an ice cream cone worth of calories. Now it's ok for me to eat an ice cream right? Kidding:)
n,accidentally clicked the wrong button on a page. Sorry for sending that farmville thing to everyone!
n,"The feminine version of the name *PROPNAME* meaning ""the woman."" Basically never printed on magnets, mugs or other souvenir paraphernalia. Often mistaken for *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME*, *PROPNAME* or *PROPNAME*. My name is *PROPNAME*, not *PROPNAME*, dammit. (Urbandictionary.com, type in your first name, copy and paste the first entry)"
n,is off to bed and hoping not to be woken up by things flapping and crashing from the crazy wind outside. On the up side it's going to be in the 60-70 range for the next week!:)
n,feels bad for my sick boyfriend. I know he feels really crappy 'cause he's sitting still and not playing videogames!
n,thinks it might be time for a nap:)
n,is off to work out. I don't want to but it's been 3 days:(
n,doesn't think the changes to facebook were really needed but honestly I'm more annoyed with all the complaints I've seen about it. You get it for free so if that means every once in a while you have to deal with a new layout well...deal with it!:)
n,starting to make some delicious snacks to enjoy while watching the Superbowl later
n,is home from the Lockport Mardi Gras parade and is ready for a nap!
n,really wishes that my old doctor's office would learn how to do math. I don't appreciate getting rather large bills for amounts that BSBC and I have already paid. Oh and thanks for putting it in the 120 day slot so I get to stress about further stupidity on your part resulting in a bad outcome for me.

y,is excited for July 3rd.
y,is rather enjoying her little vacation in Oshkosh.
y,Is getting married in a little over a month
y,isn't sure what to think about things.
y,is waiting for August 28th at 4:15. Horray for the beginning of the rest of my life!
y,has cold feet.
y,is terribly confused. It feels like my mind is warring with itself...
y,is thinking hard and excited for her new Xanga layout!
y,thinks pipe tobacco is way better than cigarettes.
y,doesn't know how to cope with all of this stress... I think I've cried about 10 times in the last 3 days...
y,continues to befuddle herself.
y,was NOT able to push her wedding date back to the fourth of September. The presiding judge was full-up. The date remains August 28th at 4:15.
y,"is sick.....still. And possibly jobless in 2 weeks. That is, if no more positions open up for me at Wal-mart."
y,"hopes that wal-mart hires her, now realizing her blouse was open during part of the interview."
y,maybe a kitty would be a good christmas gift for *PROPNAME*....
y,"still getting over that cold from last week.... but hey at least everyone's laid off the ""quit smoking!"" bit...."
y,is at home on her first scheduled day off. And I'm bored out of my mind.
y,is still rather fluish.
y,"is thinking that the poor girls doing that ""single ladies"" are getting dissed too much. I've seen younger girls doing lewder dances with less clothes. Seriously."
y,would work a spell if not for the moon being void of course...
y,"is sick and tired of people who comment on every SINGLE status update, no matter how INSIGNIFICANT. We've been here before, you know who you are."
y,is having a little boy!
y,"bought her 2010 Farmer's Almanac today.... horray for not having to write down every single sunrise, sunset, moonrise, moonset, and void of course pattern for next year! wOOt!"

y,thinks that she needs some numbers from friends.
y,needs someone to drink for her on Dec. 12th since I'm pregnant and can't... lol
y,"6 more days.... I'm counting down! And bah on all you snow-haters. All I know is I don't have to shovel this year, thanks to my loving hubby. Thank you hubby :)"
y,is still sick. Oh well.
y,"hm, low-signal internet? works for me."
y,"I don't want to miss this weekend, but i might have to.... shitty weather and my hubby can't work today.... I think I might cry cause I really, REALLY wanted to go..... why did I ask for snow? I only wanted a little!"
y,Finally! Snow in Reedsburg. I'm so happy there's gonna be snow on my birthday!
y,"just woke up to half an inch of snow and is so happy, she's going outside in her pajamas to sweep it off her porch! That's no sarcasm folks..... I'm really excited. :) 5 days!"
y,"is a little upset about the amount of snow, and hopes she gets enough birthday money to visit her parents this weekend."
y,"Well, Reedsburg certainly has an interesting way of plowing the streets..... 2 more days."
y,feels 8 months pregnant.... but really I'm only 5 1//2.....
y,wonders if its just coincidence that mine and my best friend's birthdays are EXACTLY twoo weeks apart.
y,Classes start 1//26 at 1:30 pm. I'm so excited!
y,"is eating stroganoff, waiting for her hubby to come home and then maybe some sleep."
y,6 more days.... I'm counting down!
y,"The siren in Reedsburg keeps going off. It's not the normal noonblast siren, it sounds like an air-raid siren and continued for 10 minutes. Can anyone tell me how to find out what the damn things mean?"
y,SLEEP>WAKE UP>EAT>MORE WALLS AND FLOORS!

y,I should have gone to bed earlier than 1:30 am..... guess I forgot that *PROPNAME* was going to be up at 7....
y,"hubby is sick, connor is crabby..... I'm just tired."
y,finally found out who got her hubby and kid sick... and is pissed that she didn't find out until her son started puking.
y,has discovered that is an AWFUL idea to sleep on her back.
y,Getting my son to take a nap is like pulling teeth.

y,So *PROPNAME* just ate the end of my highlighter... I think that means she wants me to stop studying...
y,"Went to eat some mexican food, now fixing some homemade hot cocoa and watching movies with *PROPNAME*... <3"

But it made me miss my NOLA soo much...as I told my dad, I'm sure I'll end up back home someday, but for now I need to be here. Sigh!   In other news, my cold is getting worse, blech.

n,"Surreal night...I think I might've slept and just woke up every hour and lay awake for awhile before falling back asleep again--but conversely, I might've just lain awake and semi-insensible the whole night with periods of more awareness...not sure which!  Either way, I'm tired, but surprisingly decent otherwise!"
n,"Well, lived through the Carbon Monoxide shit, though it made me sick today--luckily not sick enough to go to the damn hospital I guess; just sick enough to be puking and bedridden today. Good thing I had the day off anyway for MLK day (but my dad didn't tell me that, so I woke up ill and panicky this afternoon--nice, lol).

Sure spices up the office though haha--as long as I don't careen into the conference table!  :D"
n,"Fucking CARBON MONOXIDE alarm's going off repeatedly again tonight! Opened the windows & garage doors; I have nowhere else I can go & I need sleep, so I'm gonna hafta just hope the ventilation is enough cos I don't know what else to do.

n,is amused at the universe today. *cracks up*
n,"Hm...started the day out feeling ok, but now I feel like three-week-old leftovers molding in the back of a broken fridge in Hell...yes, a Hell-fridge. Guess work doesn't agree with me!"
n,"Been trying to catch up on sleep since I pretty much hadn't slept in 3 days...woken up by the Carbon Monoxide alarm, and it's the real deal.

y,"is glad that it's summertime, and the living is easy. One of these mornings, she'll rise up singing."
y,"just got home from spending 11 glorious hours with her family. It was an awesome day. Sorry for all the missed calls and texts, my phone died many hours ago."
y,"I'm leavin' on a cruise ship, but I do know when I'll be back again. Seriously though, no phone or internet all week, so I will be incommunicado. You kids have fun, try not to do anything too crazy."
y,is home again! The Caribbean was amazing!
y,had good talkings tonight. Fun times were had by all.
y,One more double before nine days of freedom.
y,can't stop here! This is bat country!
y,"You win some, you lose some. Week 2 doesn't say anything about the Playoffs. There's always next week. And lets be fair, the competition next week is the Chiefs. Ahahaha."
y,ought to be cast in the next big zombie movie as an extra. Because she feels like the living dead must feel after a night of heavy brain-eating. Is that their equivalent of drinking? Explains why they want to do it all the time.
y,"needs to be herself, she can't be no one else. She's feeling supersonic, give her gin and tonic. She could have it all, but how much does she want it?"
y,"Damn, those Eagles looked sharp today. Too bad the Red Sox couldn't do the same."
y,Made some cash last night playing poker. Hopefully a repeat performance tonight?
y,hasn't felt the way she feels today in so long it's hard for her to specify.
y,"has got no time to for spreadin roots, the time has come to be gone. And though our health we drank a thousand times, it's time to ramble on."
y,is at a weird place in her life right now. A road map would be handy.
y,has the damn flu. Could the universe's timing have been any worse? She thinks not.
y,"Woot, go Chiefs. :D"
y,would love to have something that even remotely resembles a reasonable sleep schedule.
y,feels severely under-appreciated. It's lame.
y,"has had a very good day, and looks to have a good night also."
y,"doesn't look different, but she has changed. You're looking through her, she's not the same."
y,"wants to live where soul meets body, and let the sun wrap its arms around her, and bathe her skin in water cool and cleansing, and feel, feel what it's like to be new."
y,"has learned that standing in front of her open refridgerator and freezer doesn't make any of her food look any more appetizing, but it does start defrosting the food in her freezer."
y,proved her epic ninja skills tonight.
y,"shall live in the sunshine, swim the sea, and drink the wild air's salubrity."
y,was hoping some of the punk kids in her apartment complex would nab the jack-o-lanterns off her balcony and give them the honor of a good smash. Instead she had to unceremoniously toss them in the dumpster.
y,will begin tomorrow well and serenely and with too high a spirit to be encumbered with her old nonsense.
y,is gonna blame it all upon a rush of blood to the head.
y,"had one of her worst nights ever at work, after spending all day actually believing today would be a good day."
y,"will have a bit of fun, watching everyone pass her by."
y,"is sitting in an English garden, waiting for the sun."
y,(573): Fact: The drinking you do in college doesn't affect your liver in real life.
y,wanted more than life could ever grant. She's bored with the chore of saving face.
y,"loves that she has some of the nerdiest friends ever. She's seen at least ten *PROPNAME* poems posted today. Granted, everyone picks the same one from V for Vendetta, but m'eh."
y,is feeling uninspired and unmotivated. Can someone else please pay her bills and move her into her new apartment?
y,is tired of being passed over.
y,has gotta tell you what a state she's in...
y,is having the worst day since yesterday.
y,learns more and more every day that timing is everything.
y,"is still living with your ghost, lonely and dreaming of the west coast. She just wants to feel some sunshine."
y,"just thought that you would know you're a god, and she is not."
y,"took these broken wings and learned to fly. All her life, she was only waiting for this moment to arise."
y,"doesn't want to be at the mercy of her emotions. She wants to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them."
y,"is watching the lights go down, letting the cables sleep. Whatever you say, it's all right, whatever you do it's all good."
y,"is simultaneously packing, doing laundry, cleaning, and jamming out.  Ah, productivity."
y,"is home from work and back to packing//cleaning. January 2nd can't come soon enough, because this is starting to get really monotonous."
y,can be painfully petty and selfish at times.
y,"Doppelgänger week; change your profile picture to someone famous you have been told you look like. After you update your profile with your evil twin photo, then cut and paste this to your status."
y,wants the kind of things that money just can't buy.
y,hates to admit that she's becoming more and more of a morning person.
y,is very glad to see that it's legitimately storming outside. If only she didn't have to go back to work in just a few minutes...
y,"is, by far, the biggest nerd she knows sometimes. Which really says a lot if you know her friends."
y,just realized she's been awake for 22 hours. That might explain the exhaustion.
y,"had an amazing night last night, in spite of the fact that she was literally falling asleep on her feet."
y,Your grace is more than enough. Re-prioritization in progress.

n,Anyone who can be replaced by a machine deserves to be
n,may have overworked my abs today...feel torn
n,The undertaking of a new action brings new strength
n,going for a long run hit me up later
n,Most people never run far enough on their first wind to find out they've got a second
n,"I like running because it's a challenge.  If you run hard, there's the pain - and you've got to work your way through the pain.  You know, lately it seems all you hear is? Don't overdo it' and? Don't push yourself.' Well, I think that's a lot of bull shit.  If you push the human body, it will respond"
n,The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it.
n,The trouble with being punctual is that nobody's there to appreciate it
n,if you want to be a leader try and act like one
n,"There is genius in persistence. It conquers all opposers. It gives confidence. It annihilates obstacles. Everybody believes in a determined man. People know that when he undertakes a thing, the battle is half won, for his rule is to accomplish whatever he sets out to do."
n,"If I am not for myself, who will be for me? If I am not for others, what am I?And if not now, when?"
n,lunch then going to work out....Any workout which does not involve a certain amount of danger or responsibility does not improve the body - it just wears it out
n,The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit. The second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are
n,You don't drown by falling in water. You drown by staying there.
n,"If I had to select one quality, one personal characteristic that I regard as being most highly correlated with success, whatever the field, I would pick the trait of persistence. Determination. The will to endure to the end, to get knocked down seventy times and get up off the floor saying, ''Here comes number seventy-one!"
n,".if we wait for the moment when everything,  absolutely everything is ready, we shall never begin"
n,getting smoked tonight
n,"I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it."

n,good day...goodnight
n,got my battle rattle ready
n,Education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance
n,Common sense in an uncommon degree is what the world calls wisdom
n,Executive ability is deciding quickly and getting somebody else to do the work.
n,Those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't.
n,Why did I want to win? because I didn't want to lose!
n,despise the fact i have already been up for almost 3 hours
n,Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent
n,The will to win means nothing without the will to prepare
n,"Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit."
n,I've got a great ambition to die of exhaustion rather than boredom
n,If life gives you lemons - make grapejuice. Then sit back and let people wonder how you did it.
n,"Since light travels faster than sound,  people appear bright until you hear them speak"
n,"If you can't convince them, confuse them"
n,first free weekend
n,The power of accurate observation is frequently called cynicism by those who don't have it
n,"Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure, than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat."
n,"Here's to you and here's to me, and I hope we never disagree. But, if that should ever be, to HELL with you, here's to ME"
n,Just because everything's different doesn't mean anything's changed
n,"As it is the characteristic of great wits to say much in few words, so small wits seem to have the gift of speaking much and saying nothing."
n,It doesn't work to leap a twenty-foot canyon in two ten-foot jumps
n,Common sense is instinct.  Enough of it is genius
n,finished ruck run
n,I've always felt it was not up to anyone else to make me give my best
n,Sometimes                            it is entirely appropriate to kill a fly with a sledge                            hammer
n,chem test
n,Dreams permit each and every one of us to be quietly and safely insane every night of our lives
n,"I'm not the greatest; I'm the double greatest. Not only do I knock 'em out, I pick the round."
n,"If one can stick to the training throughout the many long years, then will power is no longer a problem. It's raining? That doesn't matter. I am tired? That's besides the point. It's simply that I just have to"
n,"It seems rather incongruous that in a society of supersophisticated communication, we often suffer from a shortage of listeners"
n,"If the path less traveled were the easy path, then all would take it, thus making greatness simply average"
n,People demand freedom of speech to make up  for the freedom of thought which they avoid
n,"No matter where you go, there you are"
n,"There is no point at which you can say, Well, I'm successful now. I might as well take a nap"
n,"just got back from rugby and the weight room, going to eat....hit me up later"
n,"If                            you're in a fair fight, you didn't plan it properly"
n,Your             problem is that you think you have time
n,"Light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong. No matter how fast light travels, it finds the darkness has always got there first, and is waiting for it."
n,It's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper
n,perseverance is more than endurance. it is endurance combined with absolute assurance and certainty that what we are looking for is going to happen
n,"Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way when you criticize them, you are a mile away from them and you have their shoes"
n,It is the characteristic excellence of the strong man that he can bring momentous issues to the fore and make a decision about them. The weak are always forced to decide between alternatives they have not chosen themselves.
n,"I can picture in my mind a world without war, a world without hate. And I can picture us attacking that world, because they'd never expect it"
n,"Motivation is a fire from within. If someone else tries to light that fire under you, chances are it will burn very briefly"
n,Surprise Me
n,Success is not the result of spontaneous combustion. You must set yourself on fire.
n,"If a cluttered desk is the sign of a cluttered mind, what is the significance of a clean desk?"
n,Believing requires action
n,Between two evils i always pick the one ive never tried before
n,"Those who are more adapted to the active life can prepare themselves for contemplation in the practice of the active life, while those who are more adapted to the contemplative life can take upon themselves the works of the active life so as to become yet more apt for contemplation"
n,Where am I?
n,"Thinking is more interesting than knowing, but less interesting than looking"
n,"Man imposes his own limitations, don't set any"
n,"We run, not because we think it is doing us good, but because we enjoy it and cannot help ourselves...The more restricted our society and work become, the more necessary it will be to find some outlet for this craving for freedom.  No one can say, 'You must not run faster than this, or hump higher than that.'  The human spirit is indomitable"
n,"What I must do is all that concerns me. This rule, equally arduous in actual and intellectual life, may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness. It is harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it."
n,"Restlessness is dicontent, and discontent is the first neccesity of progress"
n,I cannot have survival as my only goal.  That would be too boring.

n,the slower we move the faster we die
n,"One reason we resist making deliberate choices is that choice equals change and most of us, feeling the world is unpredictable enough, try to minimise the trauma of change in our personal lives."
n,"There are four ways, and only four ways, in which we have contact with the world. We are evaluated and classified by these four contacts: what we do, how we look, what we say, and how we say it."
n,Success is often achieved by those who don't know that failure is inevitable.
n,"Workouts are like brushing my teeth; I don't think about them, I just do them.  The decision has already been made"
n,"Leadership is no more confined to process, than writing is to format"
n,"Staying up late reading an analysis of caesars civil war a man who lived by the quote audacity, more audacity, always audacity, his amazing success in life, war, and politics is yet another hwever old testament that fortune trully does favor the audacious a saying that seems to hold more truth with every experience i have"
n,"Everyone is trying to accomplish something big, not realizing that life is made up of little things"
n,not gonna sleep good tonight
n,"No bees, no honey; no work, no money."
n,that was fun
n,"I hate the expression ""What makes him tick.""  It is the American mind, looking for simple and singular solution, that uses the foolish expression.  A person not only ticks, he also chimes and strikes the hour, falls and breaks and has to be put together again, and sometimes stops like an electric clock in a thunderstorm"
n,going to work out..then mapping and setting up stx lanes for tonight hit me up if you want in
n,"Fight one more round. When your arms are so tired that you can hardly lift your hands to come on guard, fight one more round. When your nose is bleeding and your eyes are black and you are so tired that you wish your opponent would crack you one on the jaw and put you to sleep, fight one more round – remembering that the man who always fights one more round is never beaten"
n,"Earlier tonight, I found a picture of Waldo in jail. I didn't think much of it until I realized he was probably a wanted fugitive and that's why he is always hiding"
n,What is opportunity to the man who can't use it?
n,"Dont you find it Funny that after Monday(M) and Tuesday(T), the rest of the week says WTF?"
n,"The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled. For it is only in such moments, propelled by our discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers"
n,"Read, every day, something no one else is reading. Think, everyday, something no one else is thinking. Do, every day, something no one else would be crazy enough to do."
n,Someday
n,"There is no better time than now. The time to live is now. The time to dream is now. The time to imagine and forget the past is now. The time to shine is now. The time to bleed, sweat, and determine yourself for the things you want most is now."
n,All things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth.
n,All change is not growth; as all movement is not forward.
n,stx on friday hit me up if you want in....The greatest potential for control tends to exist at the point where action takes place.
n,Dream Great...Achieve Greatness
n,"Our business in life is not to get ahead of others, but to get ahead of ourselves -- to break our own records, to outstrip our yesterday by our today."
